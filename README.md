## How to setup & run game
1. Open **start.html**
1. Select which game mode you would like to play.
1. Enjoy!
1. Hit shuffle to start another game or return to change modes.


## How to play

The objective of the game is to arrange the tiles in order by numbers, across each row.
The game is complete when the numbers are in order and the bottom right corner consists of an empty tile.
- **Click** the tile you are trying to move (Not drag and drop)
- Pressing **Shuffle** will shuffle the tiles and restart the number of moves.

### Reminder

The only tiles that are able to move are the tiles that are directly right next to the empty tile. **No diagonals**
The number you **hover** over is the number that will be moved to the **empty tile**
